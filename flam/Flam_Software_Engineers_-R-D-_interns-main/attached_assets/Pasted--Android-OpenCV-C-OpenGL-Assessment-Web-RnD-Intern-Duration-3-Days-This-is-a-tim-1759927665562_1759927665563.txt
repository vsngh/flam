🧪 Android + OpenCV-C++ +
OpenGL Assessment + Web -
RnD Intern
📆 Duration: 3 Days
This is a time-bound technical assessment to evaluate your practical skills in
Android development, OpenCV (C++), OpenGL ES, JNI (NDK), and TypeScript
(Web). The focus is on integration and rendering, not on perfect UI or
advanced features.
⚠️ IMPORTANT:
Proper use of GitHub or GitLab for version control is mandatory.
If your project is not properly committed and pushed to a public (or shareable
private) repository, your submission will not be evaluated.
🔧 Tech Stack Requirements
Android SDK (Java/Kotlin)
NDK (Native Development Kit)
OpenGL ES 2.0+
OpenCV (C++)
JNI (Java ↔ C++ communication)
TypeScript (for a minimal web-based viewer / debug tool)
Optional: GLSL shaders, Android CameraX, or OpenCV Camera Bridge
(Java side)
🚀 Challenge: Real-Time Edge Detection Viewer
You're building a minimal Android app that captures camera frames, processes
them using OpenCV in C++ (via JNI), and displays the processed output using
OpenGL ES.

Additionally, create a small TypeScript-based web page that can receive a
dummy processed frame (static image or base64) and display it — to
demonstrate ability to bridge native processing results to a simple web layer.
🧩 Key Features (Must-Have)
1. 📸 Camera Feed Integration (Android)
Use TextureView or SurfaceTexture to capture frames from the camera.
Set up a repeating image capture stream (Camera1 or Camera2 API).
2. 🔁 Frame Processing via OpenCV (C++)
Send each frame to native code using JNI.
Apply a Canny Edge Detection or Grayscale filter using OpenCV (C++).
Return the processed image (or pass directly to OpenGL texture).
3. 🎨 Render Output with OpenGL ES
Render the processed image using OpenGL ES 2.0 (as a texture).
Ensure smooth real-time performance (minimum 10–15 FPS).
4. 🌐 Web Viewer (TypeScript)
A minimal web page (TypeScript + HTML) that displays:
A static sample processed frame (can be saved from Android run).
Basic text overlay for frame stats (FPS, resolution).
Demonstrates comfort with TypeScript project setup and DOM updates.
⚙️ Architecture Guidelines
Modular project structure, with at least:
/app (Java/Kotlin code)
/jni (C++ OpenCV processing)
/gl (OpenGL renderer classes)
/web (TypeScript web viewer)
🧪 Android + OpenCV-C++ + OpenGL Assessment  Web  RnD Intern 2
Use native C++ for all OpenCV logic.
Keep Java/Kotlin focused on camera access and UI setup.
Keep TypeScript clean, modular, and buildable via tsc .
Use proper Git commits (meaningful messages, modular changes, not one
giant dump at the end).
⭐️ Bonus (Optional)
Button to toggle between:
Raw camera feed
Edge-detected output
Add an FPS counter or log frame processing time.
Use OpenGL shaders to apply visual effects (grayscale, invert).
Add a simple WebSocket or HTTP endpoint (mock) for the web viewer.
📦 Submission Instructions
Push your entire project to a public GitHub or GitLab repo (or share a
private repo with access granted).
Your commit history should clearly reflect your development process (no
single “final commit” uploads).
Add a README.md with:
✅ Features implemented (Android + Web)
📷 Screenshots or GIF of the working app
⚙️ Setup instructions (NDK, OpenCV dependencies)
🧠 Quick explanation of architecture (JNI, frame flow, TypeScript part)
⚠️ Submissions without a proper Git repository will not be evaluated.
